# EnterpriseAnalytics

## 📌 Project Overview
EnterpriseAnalytics is an enterprise-style data analytics project focused on analyzing retail sales data to uncover meaningful business insights. The project follows a structured, real-world analytics workflow using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

This project is designed to simulate how data analysts work in real organizations — transforming raw data into actionable insights through analysis and visualization.
